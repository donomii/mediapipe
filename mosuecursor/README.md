# Mousecursor

Another webcam mouse controller.  Move your hand in front of the camera to move your mouse, pinch your finger and thumb to click.

## Instructions

Move your hand a little bit back from the camera.  Your hand should take up about 1/10th of the screen.

The detector works best when your palm is facing the camera.

## Installation


Because the install procedure for mediapipe is so difficult, I have included the compiled binaries in the this repository.  Run ```sh mousecursor.sh``` from the command line, and it should just work.

If you want to customise it, you will need to install mediapipe first.  Follow the installation instructions for the main mediapipe repository, then run sh mousecursor.sh


## Platforms

mousecursor is currently MacOSX only.
